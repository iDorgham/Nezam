# Acquire Codebase Knowledge

Produces seven populated documents in `docs/codebase/` covering everything needed to work effectively on the project.

## Output Contract (Required)

Before finishing, all of the following must be true:

1. Exactly these files exist in `docs/codebase/`: `STACK.md`, `STRUCTURE.md`, `ARCHITECTURE.md`, `CONVENTIONS.md`, `INTEGRATIONS.md`, `TESTING.md`, `CONCERNS.md`.
2. Every claim is traceable to source files, config, or terminal output.
3. Unknowns are marked as `[TODO]`; intent-dependent decisions are marked `[ASK USER]`.

## Workflow

```
- [ ] Phase 1: Run scan, read intent documents
- [ ] Phase 2: Investigate each documentation area
- [ ] Phase 3: Populate all seven docs in docs/codebase/
- [ ] Phase 4: Validate docs, present findings, resolve all [ASK USER] items
```

### Phase 1: Scan and Read Intent

1. Run the scan script from the target project root:
   ```bash
   python3 "$SKILL_ROOT/scripts/scan.py" --output docs/codebase/.codebase-scan.txt
   ```

2. Search for `PRD`, `TRD`, `README`, `ROADMAP`, `SPEC`, `DESIGN` files and read them.
3. Summarise the stated project intent before reading any source code.

### Phase 2: Investigate

Use the scan output to answer questions for each of the seven templates.

### Phase 3: Populate Templates

Fill in this order:
1. `STACK.md` — language, runtime, frameworks, all dependencies
2. `STRUCTURE.md` — directory layout, entry points, key files
3. `ARCHITECTURE.md` — layers, patterns, data flow
4. `CONVENTIONS.md` — naming, formatting, error handling, imports
5. `INTEGRATIONS.md` — external APIs, databases, auth, monitoring
6. `TESTING.md` — test frameworks, coverage, CI
7. `CONCERNS.md` — tech debt, risks, open questions
