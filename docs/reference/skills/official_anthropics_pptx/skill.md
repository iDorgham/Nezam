## Design Ideas

**Don't create boring slides.** Plain bullets on a white background won't impress anyone.

### Before Starting

- **Pick a bold, content-informed color palette**: The palette should feel designed for THIS topic.
- **Dominance over equality**: One color should dominate (60-70% visual weight).
- **Dark/light contrast**: Dark backgrounds for title + conclusion slides, light for content.
- **Commit to a visual motif**: Pick ONE distinctive element and repeat it.

### Color Palettes

| Theme | Primary | Secondary | Accent |
|-------|---------|-----------|--------|
| **Midnight Executive** | `1E2761` (navy) | `CADCFC` (ice blue) | `FFFFFF` (white) |
| **Forest & Moss** | `2C5F2D` (forest) | `97BC62` (moss) | `F5F5F5` (cream) |
| **Coral Energy** | `F96167` (coral) | `F9E795` (gold) | `2F3C7E` (navy) |
| **Warm Terracotta** | `B85042` (terracotta) | `E7E8D1` (sand) | `A7BEAE` (sage) |

### For Each Slide

**Every slide needs a visual element** — image, chart, icon, or shape. Text-only slides are forgettable.
