# Omni AI Optimizer

Optimize your Omni semantic model so Blobby (the Omni Agent) returns accurate, contextual answers.

> **Tip**: Use `omni-model-explorer` to inspect current AI context before making changes.

## Prerequisites

```bash
# Verify the Omni CLI is installed — if not, ask the user to install it
# See: https://github.com/exploreomni/cli#readme
command -v omni >/dev/null || echo "ERROR: Omni CLI is not installed."
```

```bash
export OMNI_BASE_URL="https://yourorg.omniapp.co"
export OMNI_API_TOKEN="your-api-key"
```

Requires **Modeler** or **Connection Admin** permissions.

## Discovering Commands

```bash
omni models --help                    # List all model operations
omni models yaml-create --help        # Show flags for writing YAML
```

## How Blobby Works

Blobby generates queries by examining:

1. **Topic structure** — which views and fields are joined
2. **Field labels and descriptions** — how fields are named
3. **`synonyms`** — alternative names for fields
4. **`ai_context`** — explicit instructions you write
5. **`ai_fields`** — which fields are visible to AI
6. **`sample_queries`** — example questions with correct queries
7. **Hidden fields** — `hidden: true` fields are excluded
8. **`ai_chat_topics`** — which topics are included/excluded from AI chat (model-level)

Impact order: ai_context > ai_fields > sample_queries > synonyms > field descriptions.

## Writing ai_context

Add via the YAML API:

```bash
omni models yaml-create <modelId> --body '{
  "fileName": "order_transactions.topic",
  "yaml": "base_view: order_items\nlabel: Order Transactions\nai_context: |\n  Map \"revenue\" → total_revenue. Map \"orders\" → count.\n  Map \"customers\" → unique_users.\n  Status values: complete, pending, cancelled, returned.\n  Only complete orders for revenue unless specified otherwise.",
  "mode": "extension",
  "commitMessage": "Add AI context to order transactions topic"
}'
```

### What Makes Good ai_context

**Terminology mapping** — map business language to field names:

```yaml
ai_context: |
  "revenue" or "sales" → order_items.total_revenue
  "orders" → order_items.count
  "customers" → users.count or order_items.unique_users
  "AOV" → order_items.average_order_value
```

**Data nuances** — explain what isn't obvious from field names:

```yaml
ai_context: |
  Each row is a line item, not an order. One order has multiple line items.
  total_revenue already excludes returns and cancellations.
  Dates are in UTC.
```

**Behavioral guidance** — direct common patterns:

```yaml
ai_context: |
  For trends, default to weekly granularity, sort ascending.
  For "top N", sort descending and limit to 10.
```

**Persona prompting** — set the analytical perspective:

```yaml
ai_context: |
  You are the head of finance analyzing customer payment data.
  Default to monetary values in USD with 2 decimal places.
```

### Keeping Context Concise

Every token in `ai_context`, `description`, and `label` is sent to the AI on every query. Verbose values waste context window and push out other fields.

- Target 1-2 sentences per `ai_context` entry. Focus on disambiguation and gotchas, not general explanation.
- Keep labels short and human-readable — avoid redundant qualification (e.g., "Order Total Revenue Amount" → "Total Revenue").
- Rewrite long `description` values to be direct. If a description restates the field name, remove it.

## Curating Fields with ai_fields

The AI context window holds ~550 fields before truncation. If a topic approaches this limit, use `ai_fields` to curate which fields are included.

Reduce noise for large models:

```yaml
ai_fields:
  - all_views.*
  - -tag:internal
  - -distribution_centers.*

# Or explicit list
ai_fields:
  - order_items.created_at
  - order_items.total_revenue
  - order_items.count
  - users.name
  - users.state
  - products.category
```

Same operators as topic `fields`: wildcard (`*`), negation (`-`), tags (`tag:`).

## Controlling Topic Visibility with ai_chat_topics

`ai_chat_topics` is a model-level property that controls which topics Blobby can see:

- **No `ai_chat_topics` property** (default) — Blobby can query across all topics.
- **`ai_chat_topics: []`** (empty list) — Blobby cannot query any topics. This effectively disables AI chat for the model.
- **Explicit list** — only the listed topics (or tag matches) are available. Supports `all_topics`, tag selectors (`tag:customer_facing`), and negation (`-tag:internal`, `-staging_events`).

Check this first — if a topic isn't in `ai_chat_topics`, no amount of `ai_context` or `ai_fields` on it will matter. Use `omni-model-builder` to modify this property.

## Adding sample_queries

Teach Blobby by example. Build the correct query in a workbook, retrieve its structure, then add to the topic YAML:

```yaml
sample_queries:
  revenue_by_month:
    prompt: "What month has the highest revenue?"
    ai_context: "Use total_revenue grouped by month, sorted descending, limit 1"
    query:
      base_view: order_items
      fields:
        - order_items.created_at[month]
        - order_items.total_revenue
      topic: order_transactions
      limit: 1
      sorts:
        - field: order_items.total_revenue
          desc: true
```

> **Note**: When exporting queries from Omni's workbook, you'll get JSON with `table`, `join_paths_from_topic_name`, and `sorts` using `column_name`/`sort_descending`. Map these to YAML as follows:
> - `table` → `base_view`
> - `join_paths_from_topic_name` → `topic`
> - `column_name` → `field`, `sort_descending` → `desc`
> - Workbook JSON includes `filters`, `pivots`, `limit`, `column_limit` which you can include in YAML (though filter syntax requires consulting the [Model YAML API docs](https://docs.omni.co/api/models.md) directly)

Focus on questions users actually ask — check Analytics > AI usage in Omni.

## AI-Specific Topic Extensions

Create a curated topic variant for Blobby using `extends`:

```yaml
# ai_order_transactions.topic
extends: [order_items]
label: AI - Order Transactions

fields:
  - order_items.created_at
  - order_items.status
  - order_items.total_revenue
  - order_items.count
  - users.name
  - users.state
  - products.category

ai_context: |
  Curated view of order data for AI analysis.
  [detailed context here]

sample_queries:
  top_categories_last_month:
    prompt: "Top selling categories last month?"
    query:
      base_view: order_items
      fields:
        - products.category
        - order_items.total_revenue
      topic: ai_order_transactions
      limit: 10
      sorts:
        - field: order_items.total_revenue
          desc: true
```

## Improving Field Descriptions

```yaml
dimensions:
  status:
    label: Order Status
    description: >
      Current fulfillment status. Values: complete, pending, cancelled, returned.
      Use 'complete' for revenue calculations.
```

Good descriptions help both Blobby and human analysts.

### Enumerating Values for Categorical Fields

For closed-set enums, use `all_values` so Blobby knows every valid filter value:

```yaml
dimensions:
  status:
    all_values: [complete, pending, cancelled, returned]
  payment_method:
    all_values: [credit_card, debit_card, bank_transfer, paypal, gift_card]
```

For open-ended categoricals where a full list isn't practical, use `sample_values` to give representative examples:

```yaml
dimensions:
  product_category:
    sample_values: [Electronics, Clothing, Home & Garden, Sports, Books]
  city:
    sample_values: [New York, Los Angeles, Chicago, Houston, Phoenix]
```

## Adding synonyms

Map alternative names, abbreviations, and domain-specific terminology so Blobby matches user queries to the correct field. Works on both dimensions and measures.

```yaml
dimensions:
  customer_name:
    synonyms: [client, account, buyer, purchaser]
  order_date:
    synonyms: [purchase date, transaction date, order timestamp]

measures:
  total_revenue:
    synonyms: [sales, income, earnings, gross revenue, top line]
  average_order_value:
    synonyms: [AOV, avg order, basket size]
```

**Synonyms vs ai_context**: Use `synonyms` for field-level name mapping. Use `ai_context` for topic-level behavioral guidance, data nuances, and multi-field relationships.

**Pruning caveat**: When the model is large and context is tight, synonyms are pruned before descriptions. Reserve synonyms for high-value fields where users commonly use alternative names.

**Avoid redundancy**: Don't add synonyms that duplicate the field's label or field name — they add no signal and waste tokens.

## Avoiding Duplication

`ai_context` and `description` serve different audiences. `description` is human-facing (shown in the field picker and docs). `ai_context` is an AI-only hint. Don't put the same text in both — `ai_context` should add guidance the description doesn't cover (disambiguation, gotchas, when to use one field over another).

**Consolidate shared context at the view level.** If multiple fields in a view share the same `ai_context` (e.g., "all monetary values are in USD"), move it to the view-level `ai_context` instead of repeating it on each field. Field-level `ai_context` should be specific to that field.

**Example — before:**

```yaml
dimensions:
  gross_revenue:
    ai_context: "Monetary value in USD. This is revenue before refunds."
    description: "Monetary value in USD. This is revenue before refunds."
  net_revenue:
    ai_context: "Monetary value in USD. This is revenue after refunds."
    description: "Monetary value in USD. This is revenue after refunds."
```

**After:**

```yaml
ai_context: "All monetary values in this view are in USD."

dimensions:
  gross_revenue:
    ai_context: "Revenue before refunds."
    description: "Total revenue before refunds and cancellations are applied."
  net_revenue:
    ai_context: "Revenue after refunds. Use this for profitability analysis."
    description: "Total revenue after refunds and cancellations."
```

## Optimization Checklist

Prioritize high-impact changes. Improve wording without changing semantics.

1. Inspect current state with `omni-model-explorer`
2. Check model-level `ai_chat_topics` — ensure the right topics are visible to AI
3. Check AI usage dashboard for real user questions
4. Count fields — curate with `ai_fields` if approaching 550
5. Write `ai_context` mapping business terms to fields (keep to 1-2 sentences)
6. Add `synonyms` to key dimensions and measures (skip if they duplicate the label)
7. Improve field `description` and `label` values
8. Add `all_values`/`sample_values` for categorical fields
9. Add `sample_queries` for top 3-5 questions
10. Remove duplication between `ai_context` and `description`; consolidate shared context at view level
11. Consider `extends` for AI-specific topic variants
12. Test iteratively — ask Blobby and refine
